Django Ray is a new approach to front-end development with Django. The primary goal is to abstract the complexity of backend development (including VCS) to front-end interface designers by letting them edit templates and static media on a deployed project through a rich web interface.

The purpose to to give interface designer a quick access to front-end code without the hassle of running a development copy of the project locally.

The editor is currently at early design stage and not ready for production use. **The code in the trunk is only the first working prototype, use at your own risk**.
